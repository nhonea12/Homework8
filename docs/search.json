When the data was read in, Date was included as a character variable, but after using the dmy() function from the lubridate package, the date variable (now lowercase) is of the date data type. After looking at the unique levels of each other character variable, the remaining character variables have been stored as factors, with their names updated to be more compatible with R.\nAll the numeric variables also had their names updated, so now every variable in our data set has lower, snake-case variable names.\n\n# summary stats across categorical variables (especially for rented bike count)\n# mean and standard deviation of bikes rented per hour grouped by season\nbike_data |&gt; \n  group_by(season) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    mean_rentals = mean(bike_count),\n    sd_rentals = sd(bike_count)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 4 × 3\n  season mean_rentals sd_rentals\n  &lt;fct&gt;         &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Autumn         820.       651.\n2 Spring         730.       622.\n3 Summer        1034.       690.\n4 Winter         226.       150.\n\n\nThe above table gives us the mean and standard deviation of hourly bike rentals in Seoul in 2018, grouped by the season.\n\n# mean and standard deviation of bikes rented per hour grouped by whether is it a holiday or not\nbike_data |&gt; \n  group_by(holiday) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    mean_rentals = mean(bike_count),\n    sd_rentals = sd(bike_count)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  holiday    mean_rentals sd_rentals\n  &lt;fct&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Holiday            500.       571.\n2 No Holiday         715.       647.\n\n\nThe above table gives us the mean and standard deviation of hourly bike rentals in Seoul in 2018, grouped by whether it is a holiday.\n\n# mean and standard deviation of bikes rented per hour grouped by whether the bike rental place is available (will be mean and sd 0 when non-functional hours)\nbike_data |&gt; \n  group_by(functioning_day) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    mean_rentals = mean(bike_count),\n    sd_rentals = sd(bike_count)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  functioning_day mean_rentals sd_rentals\n  &lt;fct&gt;                  &lt;dbl&gt;      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 No                        0          0 \n2 Yes                     729.       642.\n\n\nThe above table gives us the mean and standard deviation of hourly bike rentals in Seoul in 2018, grouped by whether it is functioning hours.

The points are colored by the season of the day. It makes sense that many of the points are at 0 on the x-axis, as many days have no snow at all. All of the points not at 0 on the x-axis are in the Autumn or Winter, with the majority in the Winter, which makes sense as these are the coldest months in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\n# plot rented bikes by humidity, grouped by season\nggplot(data = bike_data, aes(x = mean_humidity, y = bike_count, colour = season)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Daily Bike Rentals in Seoul\",\n    subtitle = \"Colored by Season\",\n    x = \"Average Humidity for the Day (%)\",\n    y = \"Number of Bikes Rented\"\n  ) + \n  scale_color_discrete(name = \"Season:\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above scatter plot shows how many bikes were rented in day based on the average humidity that day.

The points are colored by the season of the day. It appears the there is a positive correlation between temperature and daily bike rentals, possibly because people are more likely to want to do outdoor activities like ride a bike when it is warmer outside. However, there may be some non-linear effect, where when the temperature gets too high, the number of bike rentals goes down, as people feel it is too hot.\n\n# plot rented bikes by solar radiation, grouped by season\nggplot(data = bike_data, aes(x = mean_solar_rad, y = bike_count, colour = season)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Daily Bike Rentals in Seoul\",\n    subtitle = \"Colored by Season\",\n    x = \"Average Solar Radiation for the Day (MJ/m2)\",\n    y = \"Number of Bikes Rented\"\n  ) + \n  scale_color_discrete(name = \"Season:\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above scatter plot shows how many bikes were rented in day based on the average solar radiation that day. The points are colored by the season of the day. It appears the there is a positive correlation between solar radiation and daily bike rentals, possibly because people are more likely to want to do outdoor activities like ride a bike when it is sunny outside.\n\n# plot rented bikes by visibility, grouped by season\nggplot(data = bike_data, aes(x = mean_visibility, y = bike_count, colour = season)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Daily Bike Rentals in Seoul\",\n    subtitle = \"Colored by Season\",\n    x = \"Average Visibility for the Day (10m)\",\n    y = \"Number of Bikes Rented\"\n  ) + \n  scale_color_discrete(name = \"Season:\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above scatter plot shows how many bikes were rented in day based on the average visibility that day.

Positive numbers indicate a positive relationship, while negative numbers indicate a negative, or inverse, relationship. The closer to 1 or -1, the stronger the linear relationship is. The closer to 0, the weaker the linear relationship is."
